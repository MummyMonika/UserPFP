# UserPFP

UserPFP provides an alternative source for Discord profile pictures and allows for GIFs and custom API's, e.g. to randomise your image on each load.

## Using UserPFP

To use UserPFP, you have to install or import a plugin or theme on a modified Discord client. Currently supported clients are:

[Revenge](https://github.com/revenge-mod) using a plugin

[Vencord](https://vencord.dev) using a theme ([Equicord](https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord) includes a plugin)

[Betterdiscord](https://betterdiscord.app) using a theme

[Replugged](https://replugged.dev/) using a plugin-theme hybrid

After that, you will have to submit a profile picture for review, either using the plugin settings or by joining our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/userpfp-1129784704267210844)

Special thanks to:

[p0rtl](https://github.com/p0rtL6) with her project [usrbg](https://github.com/Discord-Custom-Covers/usrbg), which was the inspiration for UserPFP

[thororen](https://github.com/thororen1234) with [Equicord](https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord), which adds features from Vencord pull requests that aren't accepted out of sheer negligence, allowing UserPFP to get its deserved plugin.
